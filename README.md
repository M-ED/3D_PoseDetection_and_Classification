# 3D Pose Detection using MediaPipe, OpenCV, and Matplotlib

This project focuses on real-time 3D pose detection using Mediapipe's Pose solution, integrated with OpenCV for image processing and Matplotlib for visualization. The project demonstrates how to detect and visualize human pose landmarks in 2D and 3D.





## Features

- Detect human pose landmarks in images.
- Visualize landmarks in both 2D and 3D.
- Annotate detected landmarks on images.
### How it works

- The code loads an image, detects the human pose in it using Mediapipe, and visualizes the detected landmarks both on the image and in 3D space.
- It provides a comprehensive view of how human pose estimation can be done on static images with visualization tools.
## Prerequisites
- Python 3.9.0 or higher 
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/M-ED/3D_PoseDetection_and_Classification.git
```
2. Create virtual environment using following commands:
```bash
  conda create -n projects_CV python==3.9.0
  conda activate projects_CV
```

3. Install the necessary libraries in requirements file
```bash
